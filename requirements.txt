I've made these key changes:
1.  **Replaced `streamlit-mic-recorder` with `st.audio_input` in `app.py`:** This uses Streamlit's native component for audio recording.
2.  **Added `st.audio`:** After you record, a player will appear so you can listen to what you've captured before it's processed.
3.  **Updated State Management:** I've implemented a callback function (`on_new_recording`) and session state flags to ensure the audio is processed only once per recording, preventing unnecessary re-transcriptions.
4.  **Simplified Audio File Handling:** `st.audio_input` provides a complete WAV file, so the code no longer needs to manually construct the WAV header.
5.  **Cleaned `requirements.txt`:** Removed the now-unused `streamlit-mic-recorder` library.

You should now be able to run your Streamlit app, and it will correctly use the built-in browser recording functionality. Let me know if you have any other questions
